# ESP32 Autonomous wall following  Robot with Multi-Sensor System & Parallel Processing

This project is an **ESP32-based autonomous robot** equipped with:
- **VL53L0X ToF distance sensors** for obstacle detection
- **TCS34725 color sensor** for color recognition
- **MPU6050 gyroscope & accelerometer** for orientation and stability
- **L298N motor driver** for precise motor control
- **I2C multiplexer (TCA9548A)** for managing multiple I2C devices

The robot uses **parallel processing** with **FreeRTOS** to improve performance:
- **Core 0**: Continuously reads and processes sensor data (distance, color, orientation)
- **Core 1**: Executes decision-making algorithms and drives motors in real time

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Real-Time Obstacle Detection**  
  Uses multiple VL53L0X sensors via an I2C multiplexer for 360Â° coverage.
- **Color-Based Navigation**  
  Detects and reacts to specific colors using the TCS34725 sensor.
- **Stability & Orientation Control**  
  Reads gyroscope/accelerometer data from the MPU6050.
- **Parallel Processing for Efficiency**  
  Sensor reading and decision-making run independently on separate CPU cores.
- **Scalable Sensor Integration**  
  Easily add more I2C devices without address conflicts.
- **Smooth Motor Control**  
  Powered by TB6612FNG dual-channel motor driver.
